          Michael Holbrook Penniman Jr. (born 18 August 1983), known by his

          <br />
          After recording his first extended play, Dodgy Holiday, Mika was named
          the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2007 in an annual BBC
          poll of music critics, Sound of 2007.Mika released his first
          full-length studio album, Life in Cartoon Motion, on Island Records in
          2007, which sold more than 5.6 million copies worldwide and helped
          Mika win a Brit Award—winning Best British Breakthrough act—and
          receive a Grammy Award nomination. He topped the UK Singles Chart in
          January 2007 with "Grace Kelly". He has since gone on to record four
          more studio albums (most recently My Name is Michael Holbrook released
          in October 2019), as well as serve as judge/mentor on both the French
          version of The Voice and the Italian version of X Factor. Mika has
          also starred in his own television variety show in Italy, Stasera Casa
          Mika, which won the 2017 Rose d'Or Award for Entertainment.
